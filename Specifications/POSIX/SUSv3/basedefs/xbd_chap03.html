<p>The smallest entity used to determine the logical ordering of character or wide-character strings; see also <a href=

causes the call to return immediately when the thread would otherwise be delayed in the write operation; for example, because no
space was available. For networking, it causes functions not to await protocol events (for example, acknowledgements) to occur. See

<h3><a name="tag_03_430">   3.430 </a>Vertical-Tab Character (&lt;vertical-tab&gt;)</h3>

<p>A character that in the output stream indicates that printing should start at the next vertical tabulation position. It is the
character designated by <tt>'\v'</tt> in the C language. If the current position is at or past the last defined vertical tabulation
position, the behavior is unspecified. It is unspecified whether this character is the exact sequence transmitted to an output
device by the system to accomplish the tabulation.</p>

<p>A sequence of one or more characters that belong to the <b>space</b> character class as defined via the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category

<p>In the POSIX locale, white space consists of one or more &lt;blank&gt;s ( &lt;space&gt;s and &lt;tab&gt;s), &lt;newline&gt;s,
&lt;carriage-return&gt;s, &lt;form-feed&gt;s, and &lt;vertical-tab&gt;s.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_434">   3.434 </a>Wide-Character String</h3>

<p>A contiguous sequence of wide-character codes terminated by and including the first null wide-character code.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_435">   3.435 </a>Word</h3>

<p>In the shell command language, a token other than an operator. In some cases a word is also a portion of a word token: in the
various forms of parameter expansion, such as ${<i>name</i>-<i>word</i>}, and variable assignment, such as <i>name</i>=<i>word</i>,
the word is the portion of the token depicted by <i>word</i>. The concept of a word is no longer applicable following word
expansions-only fields remain. <basefont size="2"></p>
