AAD -- ASCII Adjust AX before Division

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

D5 0A     AAD            19        ASCII adjust AX before division


Operation

AL = AH * 10 + AL;
AH = 0;

Description

AAD is used to prepare two unpacked BCD digits (the least-significant
digit in AL, the most-significant digit in AH) for a division operation that
will yield an unpacked result. This is accomplished by setting AL to
AL + (10 * AH), and then setting AH to 0. AX is then equal to the binary
equivalent of the original unpacked two-digit number.
