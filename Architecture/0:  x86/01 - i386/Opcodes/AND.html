Operation

DEST = DEST AND SRC;
CF = 0;
OF = 0;

Description

Each bit of the result of the AND instruction is a 1 if both corresponding
bits of the operands are 1; otherwise, it becomes a 0.

Flags Affected

CF = 0, OF = 0; PF, SF, and ZF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;
#SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
