Operation

DEST = DEST + SRC + CF;

Description

ADC performs an integer addition of the two operands DEST and SRC and the
carry flag, CF. The result of the addition is assigned to the first operand
(DEST), and the flags are set accordingly. ADC is usually executed as part
of a multi-byte or multi-word addition operation. When an immediate byte
value is added to a word or doubleword operand, the immediate value is first
sign-extended to the size of the word or doubleword operand.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AF, CF, and PF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;
#SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) if page
fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
