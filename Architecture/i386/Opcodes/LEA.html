LEA -- Load Effective Address


Opcode  Instruction  Clocks  Description

8D  /r  LEA r16,m    2       Store effective address for m in register r16
8D  /r  LEA r32,m    2       Store effective address for m in register r32
8D  /r  LEA r16,m    2       Store effective address for m in register r16
8D  /r  LEA r32,m    2       Store effective address for m in register r32


Operation

IF OperandSize = 16 AND AddressSize = 16
THEN r16 = Addr(m);
ELSE
   IF OperandSize = 16 AND AddressSize = 32
   THEN
      r16 = Truncate_to_16bits(Addr(m));   (* 32-bit address *)
   ELSE
      IF OperandSize = 32 AND AddressSize = 16
      THEN
         r32 = Truncate_to_16bits(Addr(m));
      ELSE
         IF OperandSize = 32 AND AddressSize = 32
         THEN  r32 = Addr(m);

Description

LEA calculates the effective address (offset part) and stores it in the
specified register. The operand-size attribute of the instruction
(represented by OperandSize in the algorithm under "Operation" above) is
determined by the chosen register. The address-size attribute (represented
by AddressSize) is determined by the USE attribute of the segment containing
the second operand. The address-size and operand-size attributes affect the
action performed by LEA, as follows:

Operand Size  Address Size  Action Performed

    16            16        16-bit effective address is calculated and
                            stored in requested 16-bit register
                            destination.

    16            32        32-bit effective address is calculated. The
                            lower 16 bits of the address are stored in
                            the requested 16-bit register destination.

    32            16        16-bit effective address is calculated. The
                            16-bit address is zero-extended and stored
                            in the requested 32-bit register destination.

    32            32        32-bit effective address is calculated and
