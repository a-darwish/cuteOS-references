AAS -- ASCII Adjust AL after Subtraction

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

3F        AAS            4         ASCII adjust AL after subtraction


Operation

IF (AL AND 0FH) > 9 OR AF = 1
THEN
   AL = AL - 6;
   AL = AL AND 0FH;
   AH = AH - 1;
   AF = 1;
   CF = 1;
ELSE
   CF = 0;
   AF = 0;
FI;

Description

Execute AAS only after a SUB instruction that leaves the byte result in the
AL register. The lower nibbles of the operands of the SUB instruction must
have been in the range 0 through 9 (BCD digits). In this case, AAS adjusts
AL so it contains the correct decimal digit result. If the subtraction
produced a decimal carry, the AH register is decremented, and the carry and
auxiliary carry flags are set to 1. If no decimal carry occurred, the carry
and auxiliary carry flags are set to 0, and AH is unchanged. In either case,
AL is left with its top nibble set to 0. To convert AL to an ASCII result,
follow the AAS with OR AL, 30H.

Flags Affected

AF and CF as described above; OF, SF, ZF, and PF are undefined
