ARPL -- Adjust RPL Field of Selector

Opcode    Instruction          Clocks    Description

63 /r     ARPL r/m16,r16       pm=20/21  Adjust RPL of r/m16 to not
                                         less than RPL of r16


Operation

IF RPL bits(0,1) of DEST < RPL bits(0,1) of SRC
THEN
   ZF = 1;
   RPL bits(0,1) of DEST = RPL bits(0,1) of SRC;
ELSE
   ZF = 0;
FI;

Description

The ARPL instruction has two operands. The first operand is a 16-bit
memory variable or word register that contains the value of a selector. The
second operand is a word register. If the RPL field ("requested privilege
level"--bottom two bits) of the first operand is less than the RPL field of
the second operand, the zero flag is set to 1 and the RPL field of the
first operand is increased to match the second operand. Otherwise, the zero
flag is set to 0 and no change is made to the first operand.

ARPL appears in operating system software, not in application programs. It
is used to guarantee that a selector parameter to a subroutine does not
request more privilege than the caller is allowed. The second operand of
ARPL is normally a register that contains the CS selector value of the
caller.

Flags Affected

ZF as described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;
#SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 6; ARPL is not recognized in Real Address Mode

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
