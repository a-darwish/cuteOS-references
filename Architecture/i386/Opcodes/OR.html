Operation

DEST = DEST OR SRC;
CF = 0;
OF = 0

Description

OR computes the inclusive OR of its two operands and places the result
in the first operand. Each bit of the result is 0 if both corresponding
bits of the operands are 0; otherwise, each bit is 1.

Flags Affected

OF = 0, CF = 0; SF, ZF, and PF as described in Appendix C; AF is
undefined

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in real-address mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
